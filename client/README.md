# Gantry Client

This workspace is made up of the client binary (the _Gantry Client CLI_) and the client library, which is a Rust crate that can be used by Rust code to communicate with Gantry to query and update the catalog and stream actor bytes in and out of the registry.

The library can be found [here](./gantryclient/README.md).

Gantry is very very early alpha--use at your own risk.
